##CS213 Human-Computer Interaction Project Milestone 3##

Once upon a time, Cirky the Cellulo robot decided to leave its home on planet
Curlos, tired of spending all its time inside in front of a computer. Absorbing
the rays from two distant burning stars it suddenly glimpsed a sparkling item
out of the corner of its sensors. Bemused and intrigued, it cautiously
approached the shiny object only to realise that it was a gem. Cirky was so
excited that it barely noticed Ghost, a serious-looking Cellulo robot, modified
to act as a permanent pain in the back drive of anyone in its vicinity, rushing
towards it, ready to take it down with one swift strike.

"Cirky's Venture" is a Unity-based C# physical game where three little robots,
so-called Cellulo robots, are used. One represent the eponymous player-
controlled entity "Cirky", whereas the other two are meant to be a ghosts
hunting the latter. The player's aim is to get as many points and to to survive
as long as possible in the allotted time frame.
